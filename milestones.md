Xinyuan Sun: Last week I investigaed several blockchain security issues, including e.g. the Band Protocol's bonding curve and decentralized data governance application. Specifically, I translated the codes into OCaml and used a formal verification platform called Why3 to provide a security guarantee of it. For next week, I will write a Golang static analyzer for corresponding security properties found in the Band Protocol. Currently I am having problem on deciding the formal specification for the security vulnerabilities, as it has to be both concise and precise (as in sense of no false positives).
