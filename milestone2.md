# Milestone 2


### Haoyang Li: 
Last week, I added some common security-related vulnerabilities to Go ethereum code base. Next week, I will try to add more vulnerabilities that are more specific to blockchain security. Right now, I'm trying to understand Go ethereum code base better so that I can know where I can add those vulnerabilities more appropriately.


### Wenhao Su:
Last week, I resolved some pending bugs of the simulator and add some more features the structure. I also implemented timer 
constraint using concurrent.future, with thread safe dequeue for ACK management. 
Next week, I'll adjust more syncronizations between nodes. I'll also try to learn about consensus. Right now, I'm stuck on how to come up with innovative applications beyond the simulation.
