# Milestone 2


### Haoyang Li: 


### Wenhao Su:
Last week, I resolved some pending bugs of the simulator and add some more features the structure. I also implemented timer 
constraint using concurrent.future, with thread safe dequeue for ACK management. 
Next week, I'll adjust more syncronizations between nodes. I'll also try to learn about consensus. Right now, I'm stuck on how to come up with innovative applications beyond the simulation.
