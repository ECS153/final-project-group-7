# Milestone 3

### Haoyang Li
Last week, I implemented an NP complete problem module for babychain simulator, which can randomly generate and attemp to solve(with an existing package) a problem and verify a potential answer. The module will be used to extend babychain simulator. Next week, I'll clean up some code for babychain simulator. Right now, I'm trying to help merging the module into the simulator.


### Wenhao Su
Last week, I came up with an interesting idea of extensions for babychain simulator to be integrated with NP Complete problem solver as an example for miners to contribute their mining power to something more useful other than just bruteforcing hashes. Next week, I'll wrap everything up and prepare for the final demo. Right now, I'm stuck on how to property merge the SAT problem generator into the simulator.
