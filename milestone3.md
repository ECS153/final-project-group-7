Last week, I implemented an NP complete problem module for babychain simulator, which can randomly generate and attemp to solve(with an existing package) a problem and verify a potential answer. The module will be used to extend babychain simulator. Next week, I'll clean up some code for babychain simulator. Right now, I'm trying to help merging the module into the simulator.


### Wenhao Su
Last week, I came up with an interesting idea of extensions for babychain simulator to be integrated with NP Complete problem solver as an example for miners to contribute their mining power to something more useful other than just bruteforcing hashes. Next week, I'll wrap everything up and prepare for the final demo. Right now, I'm stuck on how to property merge the SAT problem generator into the simulator.

### Xinyuan Sun
Last week, I worked on implementing a translator which can expose the inner workings of a blockchain node. Specifically, I implemented the translator in OCaml and have the target language being a variant of ML, so that it could be easily translated into Coq for formal verification. Next week, I will implement the static analyzers based on code generated by this translator. Right now, I am stuck on formalizing a precise set of rules for the properties to be analyzed so that no false positives will be generated
