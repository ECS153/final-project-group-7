# Milestone 3


### Wenhao Su
Last week, I came up with an interesting idea of extensions for babychain simulator to be integrated with NP Complete problem solver as an example for miners to contribute their mining power to something more useful other than just bruteforcing hashes. Next week, I'll wrap everything up and prepare for the final demo. Right now, I'm stuck on how to property merge the SAT problem generator into the simulator.
